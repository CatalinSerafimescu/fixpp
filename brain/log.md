# Log

- **2026-08-29 — Created.** Routing index + the first three component decision maps
  (engine accept path, `async_mutex`, `MessageStore` teardown). Scope deliberately narrow: the
  measured deficit was ROUTING and INCOMPLETE DECISION SETS, not retrieval — see
  `decisions/speckit/brain-baseline.md` for the five atomic and two composite blind-agent runs that
  set that scope.
